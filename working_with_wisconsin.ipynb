    "### Trying to create a model for county by county data for Wisconsin.\n",
    "- Used the combined data from 2018-19 to 2022-23.\n",
    "- For 2018-19 academic year, used the population and income data for the year 2018, and so on.\n",
    "- Income and population data retrieved from the CAINC1 data file released by bea.gov.\n",
    "- The county ('Shawano') present in Wisconsin AP data but not in CAINC1 file has been manually retrieved (population from census.gov and income from federal reserve in St. Louis).\n",
    "- Used geopy to compute the average distance between counties and university. We take the five closest universities to compute the average distance.\n",
    "### Also did naïve modelling with statsmodels\n",
    "- Used 20% of the 350 datasets as testing data and the rest as training data.\n",
    "- Percentage of 3 or above score (AKA pass rate) is used as the target variable.\n",
    "- Per capita income, population and average distance to five closest R1R2, public, private (not for profit), stem and landgrant universities, as well as average enrollment in them are used as features.\n",
    "- Full model includes all features.\n",
    "- Uni metric model includes the ten university related metrics as features.\n",
    "- Non-uni model includes per capita and population as features.\n",
    "- The p-value of full model compared to uni metric model is extremely low. So, adding non-uni features (population and per capita income) to the uni-metric model improves the model.\n",
    "- The p-value of full model compared to non-uni model, while still small, is comparatively larger. So, adding uni-metric features to the economic model (population and per capita income) does not improve the model as much.\n",
    "- This is also illustrated by root mean squared error (rmse) computation on the tesitng data. The rmse with full model and non-uni model are very similar, whereas that with uni metric model is larger.\n",
    "### Also did modelling with sklearn\n",
    "- Considered the ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression (with aforementioned three types of models), PCA-then-linear-regression model (with n-components = 0.95) and Ridge model.\n",
    "- The PCA reduced the 12 features to 7 when set n-components=0.95.\n",
    "- Did 5-fold cross validation, and compared the average root mean square errors (rmse) of the models.\n",
    "- Ridge and full models had the lowest rmse, then followed by nonuni model and PCA model."
