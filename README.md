# AP-Outcomes-to-University-Metrics

AP Outcomes are often correlated to measures of socioeconomic factors. There is a somewhat reduced relationship between universities in a state and the income of that state. We are identifying relationships between Carnegie classifications of universities in a state and College Board AP Exam metrics.

## To-do Items (03 Oct 2024)

1. KPI/Shareholder Statement-Draft (04 Oct 2024)
