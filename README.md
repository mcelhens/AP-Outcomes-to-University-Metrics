Authors: Shannon Jay McElhenney, Raymond Tana, Jung-Tsung Li, Shrabana Hazra, Prabhat Devkota

AP Outcomes are often correlated to measures of socioeconomic factors. There is a somewhat reduced relationship between universities in a state and the income of that state. We are identifying relationships between Carnegie classifications of universities in a state and College Board AP Exam metrics.

## To-do Items (03 Oct 2024)

1. KPI/Shareholder Statement-Draft (04 Oct 2024)
2. Contact college board for data
    > Ask Roman/Steven about contacting the college board and their opinion on the county/state issue
3. Select reasonable metrics from Carnegie data
    > Reduce fileset
        > Select metrics not in basic definitions to include, keep all basic definitions for now
    > Keep all schools for now
    > Find duplicate universities (especially of those in different locations)
    > Online institutions?
